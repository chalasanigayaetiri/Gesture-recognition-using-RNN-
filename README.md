**Model Description**
1. LSTM Neural Network
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to learn from sequences of data. It addresses the vanishing gradient problem common in traditional RNNs, enabling it to learn long-term dependencies effectively. In gesture recognition, LSTM can capture temporal patterns in sensor data (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope readings) that correlate with specific gestures.

Methods
2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the raw sensor data for model training. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Remove any duplicates or irrelevant data points, and handle missing values.
Normalization: Scale the sensor readings (e.g., acceleration and gyroscope data) to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1 or standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps the model converge faster during training.
Label Encoding: Convert categorical labels (gesture names) into numerical values using techniques such as label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Windowing: Segment the continuous sensor data into overlapping time windows, which will be used as input sequences for the LSTM model. For instance, if using a window size of 100 time steps, each input sample will consist of 100 consecutive readings for each sensor.
3. Model Architecture
A typical LSTM model for gesture recognition might consist of the following layers:

Input Layer: The input layer receives the sequences of sensor readings.
LSTM Layer(s): One or more LSTM layers learn the temporal patterns in the data. You can adjust the number of units in the LSTM layer(s) based on your dataset size and complexity.
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer (dense layer) follows the LSTM layers, which combines features learned by the LSTM layers.
Output Layer: The final layer is typically a softmax layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of gesture classes, producing a probability distribution across the classes.
4. Training the Model
The training process involves several key components:

Loss Function: The model typically uses categorical cross-entropy as the loss function for multi-class classification problems.
Optimizer: Adam or RMSprop are commonly used optimizers that adaptively adjust the learning rate during training.
Batch Size and Epochs: Define the batch size and number of epochs for training. Experimenting with these parameters can help improve model performance.
Validation Set: Use a portion of the data as a validation set to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
5. Evaluation Metrics
To assess the model's performance, use the following metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correct predictions to the total predictions.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that illustrates the performance of the classification model by showing true vs. predicted classes.
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Metrics that provide insights into the model's performance for each class.
